# Abstract

The goal of this research project is to find whether there is an effect of music on islander's memoriation ability. The research is conducted using the open platform `The Island`[^1].

# Conjecture

From many publication references[^2], we found that music seems to have a positive effect on human being's memory. Different types of music tend to have various effects. In addition, the effect of music on memory varies among individuals, and the time it takes for the treatment to take effect also varies from one individual to another. *Therefore, our research project focuses on analyzing the effect of music on the islanders using a Latin Square design.*

# Experiment

## Design

The design that we have chosen to use in this project is Latin Square.
